echo strText = ("It was a dark cold night, and my hair was a fright. Oh! Sorry, forgot to introduce myself. My name is Loki. My brother Bor had invited me over for an evening snack. It was pitch-black. Not a sound to be heard. I clutched my baseball cap tighter in my hand. I decided to use our secret earphones to try and get a hold of Bor. When it finally found his earphone signal, all I heard was a faint help, then I lost the signal. Suddenly, a figure erupted out of the shadows. Then, everything went black. When I woke up, I noticed right away that some things were different. I was on the inside looking out. I was in a cage!! This would have been no problem for me, as I am a professional with lock picking, but there was a moat filled with crocodiles and a pit of burning oil underneath me. Suddenly, I noticed that there was somebody on the other side looking at me. Yikes! Then, I got thinking. Their cage was hanging over a pot of nails, glass, and sharp metals. Nobody in their right mind would hang over a cage like that. Suddenly, there was a loud clang. We all jumped. All of a sudden, I noticed we were moving. This was creepy! Next thing I knew, I was over top of the pit of nails, etc. and the other people were over top of the cauldron filled with boiling oil. All of a sudden, I noticed something familiar looking about the two people. Then, it hit me. It was Bestia and Bor! I had to find a way to save them and get them out of their cage. Oh, yes. Better save myself while I am at it :). Then, I had an idea. Bor was such a bore, he could put anybody to sleep. Bestia always seemed to get the best of you. As for me, I was great with locks. Getting out of my cage would be no problem if there wasn't a pit filled with crocodiles, and alligators surrounding both of our cages. I had to think fast. Then, suddenly I remembered that every member of our family had an earphone in their ear at all times. It was so small, it was naked to the human eye, but had a loud enough speaker and sensitive enough microphone that it worked perfectly. If I used our secret earphones, I could communicate with them without the guards noticing. Suddenly, I realized that there was a giant display on one end of the room. It had the number 2 on it. I wondered what that meant. Very cautiously, I poked my head out a crack in the cage and asked him “what does that number mean?” He replied, “it is a strike meter. When that number hits 0, the bottoms of your cage will fall out and you will be dropped into the pot underneath you and suffer an unholy fate. There is NO escape!” At this point, I started to panic. This was not good. At that very moment, I hear a clang. We are on the move again. Suddenly, I have an idea. First I contact Bor. As their cage goes by me, I reach out and unlock their cage. Then, I contact Bestia. It was all set. Once the cages had stopped moving, I waited until the guards turned their back and yelled KALAMAZOO!! Immediately after that, Bor started jabbering aimlessly. Within minutes, all the crocodiles and alligators were asleep. The guards stuffed cotton in their ears so they could stay awake. Once all the crocodiles and alligators had fallen asleep, Bestia jumped out of her cage. Careful not to disturb the alligators, she walked over to the guards and started beating them to a pulp. Mixing painful jokes with punches, she took both guards down within seconds. Once the guards were taken care of, she gave us the thumbs up. Just as the buzzer went off and our cage bottoms fell out, I made on desperate leap and fell right into the middle of all the crocodiles and alligators. Bor jumped out right after me and got out of the pit immediately. I had a bit more trouble getting out. By the time I was out fo the cage, the crocodiles and alligators were starting to stir. We had to move. We got out of that building faster than you can say apples and cheese do not link. That was one close call. I guess we all learned a valuable lesson.
