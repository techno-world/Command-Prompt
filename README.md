## Batch Files
Batch files use the .bat file extension and run commands on Command Prompt. The purpose of this repository is to make .bat files
that perform complicated commands, and turn them into something simple that anybody can understand.
## Utilizing the Batch Files
We are now attempting to turn the Batch files into something even easier to understand by making them into an application, allowing people an easier interface to run them.
